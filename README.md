# EECS268-Programming-II

Projects in EECS 268: Programming II at the University of Kansas. 

Course Objectives: to develop fundamental computer-based problem solving skills in the following three areas:

- Software Development : The specification, design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software to solve specific problems. Particular emphasis will be on using and extending existing objects.

- Object Oriented Programming : The syntax, semantics, and use of the basic features of a typical object oriented programming language (e.g. C++).

-Algorithms and Data Structures : Advanced methods for storing and manipulating data to effectively solve complex problems (e.g. linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, searching, and sorting).
